                    <p>Tel Aviv was founded on April 11, 1909. On that day, several dozen families gathered on the sand
                        dunes on
                        the
                        beach outside Yafo to allocate plots of land for a new neighborhood they called Ahuzat Bayit,
                        later
                        known as
                        Tel Aviv. As the families could not decide how to allocate the land, they held a lottery to
                        ensure a
                        fair
                        division. Akiva Arieh Weiss, chairman of the lottery committee and one of the prominent figures
                        in
                        the
                        city’s founding, gathered 66 grey seashells and 66 white seashells. Weiss wrote the names of the
                        participants on the white shells and the plot numbers on the grey shells. He paired a white and
                        grey
                        shell,
                        assigning each family a plot, and thus Tel Aviv’s founding families began building the first
                        modern,
                        Hebrew
                        city.
                    </p>

                    <p>The time was at a peak wave of Jewish immigration – the Second Aliya. Neighborhoods in the
                        ancient
                        port
                        city
                        of Jaffa were becoming overpopulated and crowded. Many of the newcomers were Europeans of
                        middle-class
                        origin who sought to build surroundings that would give them a sense of what they had left
                        behind.
                        They
                        wanted to build a modern suburb of Jaffa.
                    </p>

                    <p>The true development of Tel Aviv took off with the arrival of Scottish urban planner, Sir Patrick
                        Geddes.
                        In
                        response to the unplanned expansion of the city, Geddes was invited by the municipality in 1925
                        to
                        present a
                        comprehensive master plan for Tel Aviv. In his vision, Tel Aviv was to be a garden city, as
                        foreseen
                        by
                        its
                        founders. His plan called for a clear distinction between main streets, residential streets and
                        vegetation
                        filled pedestrian boulevards. An important element of his plan, reflecting the social climate of
                        the
                        time,
                        was the creation of shared public spaces - in the form of parks and squares, as well as within
                        residential
                        blocks.
                    </p>

                    <p>The city was again transformed starting in 1932 by a massive wave of immigration of Jews fleeing
                        persecution
                        in Europe whose arrival rapidly expanded a small town of 42,000 people into a flourishing city
                        of
                        130,000 by
                        1936. In 1934, in the midst of this wave (the Fifth Aliya), Tel Aviv was declared a city, and
                        Meir
                        Dizengoff, the president of its council, as its first mayor.
                    </p>

                    <p>The housing needs of this wave of immigration brought the rise of the Bauhaus, or Modern
                        Movement,
                        style
                        of
                        architecture. Many architects trained in the Modern style were among the refugees from Europe
                        who
                        began
                        rapidly building to accommodate the population growth, resulting in what today is known as the
                        White
                        City.
                        Influenced by the clean, functional lines of the Bauhaus School of Art and Design in Germany,
                        they
                        adapted
                        the Modern style to suit Tel Aviv’s culture and climate, giving the city its special look. The
                        White
                        City of
                        Tel Aviv, declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004, includes over 4,000 buildings in the
                        Modern
                        style.
                    </p>

                    <p>In the 1930's, Tel Aviv became the country’s largest economic center and had the highest
                        concentration of
                        social and cultural institutions. Tel Aviv was the center of the emergence of Hebrew culture and
                        culture
                        in
                        Hebrew – and remains so to this very day. Tel Aviv became known for its modern cafes, hotels,
                        concert
                        halls
                        and nightclubs. The city enjoyed a sense of international chic, which was rare for the region,
                        especially at
                        the time.
                    </p>

                    <p>At the start of the 1948 War of Independence, the city and its periphery became the focal point
                        of
                        the
                        conflict between Jews and Arabs. The fight over Jaffa's future started immediately after the UN
                        decision
                        for
                        partition. As in other areas where Jewish and Arab forces clashed in close quarters, civilian
                        populations
                        both in Tel Aviv and Jaffa suffered and ultimately many fled. In April 1950, Jaffa was formally
                        merged
                        with
                        the Tel Aviv municipality and a unified city was established - Tel Aviv-Yafo.
                    </p>

                    <p>The next several of decades maintained the city's status as Israel's cultural and economic
                        center,
                        yet
                        Tel
                        Aviv-Yafo was losing its vibrancy and its population was growing older. This trend changed in
                        the
                        1980s
                        as a
                        gradual migration from all over the country back to Tel Aviv began. Over the next decades, there
                        was
                        massive
                        renovation and development throughout Tel Aviv-Yafo, giving the city a makeover whose finishing
                        touches
                        are
                        still being improved upon. Tel Aviv-Yafo of today has developed a unique style combining the
                        best of
                        both a
                        relaxed Mediterranean seaside town with an edgy urban vibe. Tel Avivis are passionate about
                        their
                        city
                        and
                        are proud to live in a center of commerce, culture, style and entertainment.

                    <p>With leafy boulevards filled with people at all hours, a thriving business sector, countless
                        charming
                        cafes
                        and restaurants, a beautiful beachfront and rich cultural offerings, the vision of the city’s
                        founders
                        has
                        come alive.
                    </p>

                    <p>A Brief History of Jaffa (Yafo): Jaffa is one of the oldest port cities in the world. The word
                        Jaffa,
                        which
                        means "the beautiful" is derived from Japhfet, the name of one of Noah's sons' who built it
                        after
                        the
                        Flood.
                    </p>

                    <p>During the times of King Solomon, Jaffa's port served as a gateway for cedars from Lebanon used
                        to
                        build
                        the
                        First Temple. It was also mentioned in the Old Testament as the port from which Jonah the
                        Prophet
                        embarked
                        on his maritime journey, which resulted in him being swallowed by fish.</p>

                    <p>Over the years numerous conquerors passed through Jaffa's gates and during the Ottoman Empire it
                        was
                        one
                        of
                        the region's most important ports. In the late 1800's, Jaffa's ancient city wall was completely
                        destroyed
                        and the city expanded out into new areas.</p>


                    <p>Upon Israeli independence in 1948, Jaffa was a center of local Arab political, cultural and
                        financial
                        activity. In 1950, the Israeli government voted to merge the first Hebrew city and the ancient
                        port
                        city
                        from which it had emerged. In 1999, the municipality founded the Jaffa Development Authority,
                        aimed
                        at
                        improving infrastructure and all aspects of daily life.
