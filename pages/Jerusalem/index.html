                    <p>The United Nations proposed, in its 1947 plan for the partition of Palestine, for Jerusalem to be
                        a city
                        under international administration. The city was to be completely surrounded by the Arab state,
                        with only a
                        highway to connect international Jerusalem to the Jewish state.</p>

                    <p>Following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Jerusalem was divided. The Western half of the New City
                        became part of
                        the newly formed state of Israel, while the eastern half, along with the Old City, was occupied
                        by Jordan.
                        According to David Guinn,</p>

                    <p>Concerning Jewish holy sites, Jordan breached its commitment to appoint a committee to discuss,
                        among other
                        topics, free access of Jews to the holy sites under its jurisdiction, mainly in the Western Wall
                        and the
                        important Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives, as provided in the Article 8.2 of the Cease
                        Fire Agreement
                        between it and Israel dated April 3, 1949. Jordan permitted the paving of new roads in the
                        cemetery, and
                        tombstones were used for paving in Jordanian army camps. The Cave of Shimon the Just became a
                        stable.</p>

                    <p>According to Gerald M. Steinberg, Jordan ransacked 57 ancient synagogues, libraries and centers
                        of religious
                        study in the Old City Of Jerusalem, 12 were totally and deliberately destroyed. Those that
                        remained standing
                        were defaced, used for housing of both people and animals. Appeals were made to the United
                        Nations and in
                        the international community to declare the Old City to be an 'open city' and stop this
                        destruction, but
                        there was no response.(See also Hurva Synagogue)</p>

                    <p>On 23 January 1950, the Knesset passed a resolution that stated Jerusalem was the capital of
                        Israel.</p>
                    <p>State of Israel</p>
                    <p>DF chief rabbi Shlomo Goren blows a shofar in front of the Western Wall after its capture during
                        the Six-Day
                        War</p>

                    <p>East Jerusalem was captured by the Israel Defense Forces during the 1967 Six-Day War. The
                        Moroccan Quarter
                        containing several hundred homes was demolished and its inhabitants expelled; thereafter a
                        public plaza was
                        built in its place adjoining the Western Wall. However, the Waqf (Islamic trust) was granted
                        administration
                        of the Temple Mount and thereafter Jewish prayer on the site was prohibited by both Israeli and
                        Waqf
                        authorities.</p>

                    <p>Most Jews celebrated the event as a liberation of the city; a new Israeli holiday was created,
                        Jerusalem Day
                        (Yom Yerushalayim), and the most popular secular Hebrew song, "Jerusalem of Gold" (Yerushalayim
                        shel zahav),
                        became popular in celebration. Many large state gatherings of the State of Israel take place at
                        the Western
                        Wall today, including the swearing-in of various Israel army officers units, national ceremonies
                        such as
                        memorial services for fallen Israeli soldiers on Yom Hazikaron, huge celebrations on Yom
                        Ha'atzmaut (Israel
                        Independence Day), huge gatherings of tens of thousands on Jewish religious holidays, and
                        ongoing daily
                        prayers by regular attendees. The Western Wall has become a major tourist destination spot.</p>

                    <p>Under Israeli control, members of all religions are largely granted access to their holy sites.
                        The major
                        exceptions being security limitations placed on some Arabs from the West Bank and Gaza Strip
                        from accessing
                        holy sites due to their inadmissibility to Jerusalem, as well as limitations on Jews from
                        visiting the
                        Temple Mount due to both politically motivated restrictions (where they are allowed to walk on
                        the Mount in
                        small groups, but are forbidden to pray or study while there) and religious edicts that forbid
                        Jews from
                        trespassing on what may be the site of the Holy of the Holies. Concerns have been raised about
                        possible
                        attacks on the al-Aqsa Mosque after a serious arson attack on the mosque in 1969 (started by
                        Denis Michael
                        Rohan, an Australian fundamentalist Christian found by the court to be insane). Riots broke out
                        following
                        the opening of an exit in the Arab Quarter for the Western Wall Tunnel on the instructions of
                        the Israeli
                        Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which prior Prime Minister Shimon Peres had instructed to be
                        put on hold
                        for the sake of peace (stating "it has waited for over 1000 years, it could wait a few more").
                    </p>

                    <p>Conversely, Israeli and other Jews have showed concerns over excavations being done by the Waqf
                        on the Temple
                        Mount that could harm Temple relics, particularly excavations to the north of Solomon's Stables
                        that were
                        designed to create an emergency exit for them (having been pressured to do so by Israeli
                        authorities). Some
                        Jewish sources allege that the Waqf's excavations in Solomon's Stables also seriously harmed the
                        Southern
                        Wall; however an earthquake in 2004 that damaged the eastern wall could also be to blame.
                    </p>
                    <p>The status of East Jerusalem remains a highly controversial issue. The international community
                        does not
                        recognize the annexation of the eastern part of the city, and most countries maintain their
                        embassies in Tel
                        Aviv. In May 2018 The United States and Guatemala moved the embassies to Jerusalem. The United
                        Nations
                        Security Council Resolution 478 declared that the Knesset's 1980 "Jerusalem Law" declaring
                        Jerusalem as
                        Israel's "eternal and indivisible" capital was "null and void and must be rescinded forthwith".
                        This
                        resolution advised member states to withdraw their diplomatic representation from the city as a
                        punitive
                        measure. The council has also condemned Israeli settlement in territories captured in 1967,
                        including East
                        Jerusalem (see UNSCR 452, 465 and 741).</p>

                    <p>Since Israel gained control over East Jerusalem in 1967, Jewish settler organizations have sought
                        to
                        establish a Jewish presence in neighborhoods such as Silwan. In the 1980s, Haaretz reports, the
                        Housing
                        Ministry "then under Ariel Sharon, worked hard to seize control of property in the Old City and
                        in the
                        adjacent neighborhood of Silwan by declaring them absentee property. The suspicion arose that
                        some of the
                        transactions were not legal; an examination committee ... found numerous flaws." In particular,
                        affidavits
                        claiming that Arab homes in the area were absentee properties, filed by Jewish organizations,
                        were accepted
                        by the Custodian without any site visits or other follow-up on the claims. ElAd, a settlement
                        organization
                        which Haaretz says promotes the "Judaization" of East Jerusalem, and the Ateret Cohanim
                        organization, are
                        working to increase Jewish settlement in Silwan in cooperation with the Committee for the
                        Renewal of the
                        Yemenite Village in Shiloah. </p>
