        <h2>1. Don&rsquo;t start with the Aleph-Bet</h2>
        <p>If you are a beginner, you might think you need to know the Hebrew alphabet to get started. If you went to
            Hebrew school, you are probably familiar enough with the Aleph-Bet. You might not know it by heart, because
            you skipped every other Sunday when your parents were too tired to drag you kicking and screaming.</p>
        <p>But even if you don&rsquo;t know the Hebrew alphabet at all, don&rsquo;t start learning Hebrew by staring at
            a chart. Start by exposing yourself to real spoken Hebrew. Just listen to the sounds, the patterns, and pick
            up a word or two here and there for now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0kl62RfgPJKxzB2SUMC8fU"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Listening to Israeli music</a> might be a good way to do this.
            Or here&rsquo;s a video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeBirl8WxMI" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">Natalie Portman giving you some basic phrases</a>.
            Or if you are past that, here&rsquo;s the dreaded <a
                href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e8/85/1b/e8851bd6aebf9a61cd1be8eec397997a.gif" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">Aleph-Bet chart</a>.
            Or check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiCzoTs1AdE" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">this clip set to Debbie Friedman&rsquo;s&nbsp;Aleph-Bet song</a>.
            Or listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl1epz3tSSA" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">Victoria Hanna&rsquo;s Hebrew alphabet song</a>, which is kind of crazy and
            amazing.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Go to <em>Ulpan</em>. <em>Ulpan</em> is Hebrew for &ldquo;The best way to learn Hebrew&rdquo;</h2>
        <p>Just kidding. It literally means &ldquo;studio,&rdquo; but the fact remains: The alternatives just
            don&rsquo;t compare. The Jewish Agency started the first Ulpan in 1949 as a method to rapidly teach Hebrew
            to the hundreds of thousands of new immigrants we helped settle in the newly founded State of Israel. If you
            are a college graduate aged 22-35 <a href="https://www.jewishagency.org/ulpan-etzion/">you too can rapidly
                learn Hebrew by joining one of several branches of Ulpan Etzion across Israel</a>. You&rsquo;ll study
            Hebrew intensively along with a group of peers and have the time of your life.</p>

        <h2>3. How do you say &ldquo;Netflix and Chill&rdquo; in Ivrit?</h2>
        <p>Not ready to get on a plane to Israel, or even get off your couch? No problem. Our favorite online streaming
            services have been <a
                href="https://www.haaretz.com/life/2020-03-30/ty-article/.premium/top-israeli-tv-shows-and-films-to-binge-watch-during-the-coronavirus-lockdown/0000017f-db99-d856-a37f-ffd9eca00000"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adding more and more Israeli TV shows</a> recently. Watch
            them. Whether or not you want to learn Hebrew, these shows are amazing. Watch with subtitles. If you are
            more advanced, set the subtitles to Hebrew when available. Even if you don&rsquo;t understand everything
            that is going on, this is the best way to learn. Start with <a
                href="https://www.netflix.com/il/title/80113612" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fauda</a>, a
            show about an undercover unit in the Israeli army. You might pick up some Arabic, too.</p>

        <h2>4. The word for Radio in Hebrew is &ldquo;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493;&rdquo;</h2>
        <p>&hellip;It&rsquo;s pronounced &ldquo;rah-dee-oh.&rdquo; This might sound daunting at first. But try listening
            to the radio in Hebrew. If you are a beginner or even a little more advanced, you will probably have a lot
            of trouble with this. You probably won&rsquo;t understand one word. But pay attention closely. Eventually
            you&rsquo;ll be able to pick out a word here and there. And then eventually more and more. If you are
            committed, this can be one of the best ways to learn Hebrew. Check out <a
                href="https://glz.co.il/%D7%92%D7%9C%D7%A6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gala&rdquo;tz
                [Israel Army Radio]</a>, <a href="https://kan.org.il/live/?stationId=4483#" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">Kan Bet</a> (focused on news), or <a
                href="https://kan.org.il/live/?stationId=4490#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kan Gimmel</a>
            (focused on Hebrew music).</p>

        <h2>5. Just read the headlines</h2>
        <p>The news in Hebrew? Impossible, you say? If you are past the &ldquo;Shalom&rdquo; and &ldquo;Aleph Bet&rdquo;
            phase, try to open a Hebrew news website and just look at the headlines. Guess what they are about. Yes, the
            pictures will help you, and that&rsquo;s OK. Or if you are more advanced, dive in to the articles
            themselves. If there&rsquo;s a word you don&rsquo;t understand, don&rsquo;t worry about looking it up. Just
            skip it or guess what it means. The Hebrew in <a href="https://www.haaretz.co.il/" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">Haaretz</a> is a little more difficult. You might want to start with <a
                href="https://www.ynet.co.il/home/0,7340,L-8,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ynet</a>
            or <a href="https://www.walla.co.il/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walla</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Open a book</h2>
        <p>If you are already reading Hebrew news, good for you! But your vocabulary will be on the newsy side.
            You&rsquo;ll know all the words for political scandals, military operations and financial markets. What
            about words for emotions, adventures, food? Check the foreign language section of your local library for
            Hebrew books. Or check out some of the children&rsquo;s books in Hebrew here; you might recognize some of
            them.</p>
        <p>But really, whatever you do, the idea is to get more Hebrew into your life. Go to Israel, or travel there
            symbolically by listening to Israeli music, or just sing the Aleph-Bet song.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
